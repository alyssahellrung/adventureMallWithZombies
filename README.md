## How I Made This  
This began with an adventure game tutorial by Web Dev Simplified on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1S_NhKkvGA). I completed the tutorial, then went through and changed the story from a traditional adventure story (swords, castles, merchants, etc.) to a mall story. I also changed up the styling a bit to reflect a more 80s aesthetic.

## Future Development Ideas
I would love to turn this into a more robust game with various playable characters and the ability to have more items in the player's inventory. Pictures to accompany each question would be cool too.
